What's up Part 2:
Great work on the colors, now here's a new, refocused list of things that gotta happen.

P.S. I would create a issue on github whenever you start a task, then when you finish it. Just so it's easier for a group of people working on it.
GOALS:

1. Organize the pages:  (Just make sure all link correctly and change the old ones in the github repository to "elementsARCHIVED"
-Home -- Finished
-About (includes what we do, that we compete in CWC, and our short history)  -- Finished
-Our team. One main page with three links to our three teams: (Mechanical, Electrical, Site Development) Then on the team pages, everyone gets their own spot. -- WIP
-Competition. Short Description of the competition. -- Finished
-Join us link that links to this google form (THIS LINK IS FOR EDITORS-NOT POTENTIAL MEMBERS) 
    - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yVo103SPv000tlanYF1Biw337JqTVMYz3yi0SuTDKZ0/edit
-Support us (Industry Sponsors will be very important for us) We will have to include a "Sponsor Packet" later on

2. Fix the page's wording (get rid of any latin)

3. Fix title (Description in Issues)

4. Fix menu bar color (Description in Issues) -- Finished

Also if you think its better to scrap the HTML website and switch over to wordpress/smth else, experiment with it. YOU (calvin & aiden) got this!! I'm counting on you guys
