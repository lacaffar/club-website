Hello! (Aiden and Calvin most likely)

This is Luke, writing a little something something to help the website along. 

This Website is hosted entirely on GITHUB, all of the files are within this repository. The Website is a copy of "Solid State by HTML5 UP." So there are HTML files that have the text elemetents, then css files that format that. There's a lot here from the HTML5 UP that I don't know, so whenever making changes, it's very important to make them inch by inch. I used to plug in the whole HTML to chatGPT and say, "fix the problem." Let's just say I've lost about 3 websites that way. DONT DO THAT PLEAAASE.

If you're not Calvin/Aiden, and have any questions, email me: lacaffar@ncsu.edu 

GOALS:
Have the following pages:
-About (includes what we do, that we compete in CWC, and our short history) 
-Our team (Everyone that's in the club, not just leaders. (HEADSHOT IMPORTANT TO ME)) 
-Join us link that links to this google form (THIS LINK IS FOR EDITORS-NOT POTENTIAL MEMBERS) 
    - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yVo103SPv000tlanYF1Biw337JqTVMYz3yi0SuTDKZ0/edit
-Support us (Industry Sponsors will be very important for us) We will have to include a "Sponsor Packet" later on


XOXO
